an act to which section 182A, 182B, 182C or 182CA applies
where--
(a) the performer's consent would otherwise be required

(2) An authorisation or licence under the regulations in favour of any
person must not preclude any authorisation or licence in favour of
another person.
(3) The regulations may provide for the treatment of royalties or other
sums paid in respect of an authorisation or licence, including--

(4) The regulations may provide for determining the rights and
obligations of any person if an interest in a performer's property
rights ceases to be included in an orphan rights register (see
paragraph 1C).
(5) The regulations may provide for the Secretary of State to
determine whether any requirement of the regulations for a
person's becoming or remaining authorised has been met or
ceased to be met.
1B    (1) The Secretary of State may by regulations provide for authorising
a licensing body to grant performers' property right licences
(within the meaning of paragraph 1) in relation to a performer's
property rights where the rights owner is not the body or a person
on whose behalf the body acts.
(2) The regulations may not authorise the grant of a licence--
Schedule 2 -- Licensing of copyright and performers' property rights

owner in accordance with the regulations.
(3) Sub-paragraphs (2) to (5) of paragraph 1A apply to regulations
under this paragraph (but sub-paragraphs (3)(b) and (c) and (4)
apply only in relation to orphan rights).
1C (1) A right is an orphan right, for the purposes of an authorisation
given or to be given to a person (an "authorised person") under
paragraph 1A or 1B, if any interest in the performer's property
rights concerned is entered in a register maintained for the
purposes of this paragraph by that person (an "orphan rights
register").
(2) An authorisation in respect of an orphan right does not affect the
need for any consent--
(a) from the owner of an interest not entered in the authorised
person's orphan rights register (except in the case of an
authorisation under paragraph 1B that extends to other
interests), or
(b) from the owner of an interest that is entered in that
register, if the authorisation does not apply to that interest.
(3) An authorised person must not enter an interest in an orphan
rights register unless the authorised person--
(a) has complied with the requirements of sub-paragraph (8)
in respect of that interest and has not found the owner of
the interest, or

has complied with those requirements in respect of that
interest and that the owner of that interest has not been
found.
(4) An entry in an orphan rights register relating to an interest in a
performer's property rights must include the record kept in
accordance with sub-paragraph (8)(c).
(5) If an authorised person finds the owner of an interest entered in
that authorised person's orphan rights register, the authorised
person must remove the entry.
(6) If in relation to an interest entered in an authorised person's
orphan rights register, the authorised person--
(a) is aware that the requirements of sub-paragraph (8) were
not complied with, or
(b) is aware of information that makes it no longer reasonable
to rely on what was done in compliance with those
requirements,
the authorised person must comply as soon as possible with the
requirements of sub-paragraph (8) or remove the entry.
(7) A failure by an authorised person to comply with any of sub-
paragraphs (3) to (6) in relation to an interest to which an
authorisation applies--
Schedule 2 -- Licensing of copyright and performers' property rights
Part 2 -- Performers' property rights

(a)   does not affect the authorisation in relation to that interest,
except so far as regulations may provide, but
(b)   is actionable as a breach of statutory duty owed to the
owner of that interest.
(8) The requirements of this sub-paragraph in respect of any interest
in a performer's property rights are--
(a) to carry out a reasonable search to find or, if necessary, to
identify and find, the owner of the interest,
(b) after the search, to publish notice of the proposal to enter
the interest in an orphan rights register, in a way designed
to bring the proposal to the attention of the owner of that
interest, and
(c) to keep a sufficient record of the steps taken under
paragraphs (a) and (b) and of the results of those steps.
(9) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (8)(a) the person carrying out
the search must in particular--
(a) make such use as is reasonable of sources of information,
including sources within sub-paragraph (10), relating to
